    - Problems:

        Lethargic resistance to starting the session. Session itself
        was a healthy sequence of forgetting, remembering, and
        returning to the breath. Mental formations (is that the term?)
        in general and internal speech in particular often lingered
        after remembering and returning to the breath.
