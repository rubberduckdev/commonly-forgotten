title: Switching back to a dumbphone
date: 2018-06-21

My Samsung Galaxy 3's power socket would not charge its battery and
that's a good thing. It's an excuse to move back to a dumbphone. No
destructive distractions in a dissociative daze. More time to read
books and enjoy quality podcasts. Additionally, battery life is huge
due to the low power consumption.
