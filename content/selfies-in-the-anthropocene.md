   * Current threats to habitat.
      * Industry?
      * Agri?
      * Water scarcity?
      * Climate change?
   * Solutions:
      * Can grassroots work?
      * State of nature reserves?
         * Are they enough?
         * Are they shrinking?
         * Are Israeli standards comparable to civilized countries?

   * Obviously, they did, many times, but not for this batch of essays.
   * Who wrote about this already?
   * Anything good?
