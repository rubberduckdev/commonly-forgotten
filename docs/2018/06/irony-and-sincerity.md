# irony versus sincerity in conversations

## Possible topics
- roles of irony in voicing unpopular opinions (I am not sure how much each of these play a role generally):
    - showing a low level of commitment to one's opinions to others.

        > It's just a meme, bro!

    - having a loose and uncommitted relationship to opinions and ideas.

        (to oneself:)
        > It's just a joke. I don't even believe it, so I'm fine morally.

    - humour helps keeping an audience's attention, as seen in satirists' works.
    - being able to voice your actual hateful opinions. ![Hateful Opinions]
